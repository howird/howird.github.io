# Transfer Functions

- The transfer function is obtained by the $\mathcal{L}$-transform and solving for the ratio between input and output

$$
Y(s)=G(s)U(s) \implies G(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{G(s)}
$$

## Poles and Zeros

- The frequencies that elicit __zero system response__ are the __zeros__ of the transfer function, and can be represented by the roots of the numerator polynomial

$$
\{s|s\in \mathbb{Z},0 = \text{numerator}(s)\}
$$

- The frequencies where the system response is __undefined__ are the __poles__ and can be represented by the roots of the denominator polynomial

$$
\{s|s\in \mathbb{Z},0 = \text{denominator}(s)\}
$$
